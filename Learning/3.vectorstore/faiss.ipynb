    "## Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**`embeddings.embed_documents()`** - Manual embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns a **list of vectors** (numerical arrays)\n",
    "- Just the raw embeddings, no storage or indexing\n",
    "- You need to manually handle storage, indexing, and similarity search\n",
    "- Lower-level control but more work\n",
    "\n",
    "**`FAISS.from_documents()`** - Automatic vector store creation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a **complete vector store object** with built-in indexing\n",
    "- Embeds the documents AND stores them in a FAISS index\n",
    "- Provides ready-to-use similarity search methods\n",
    "- Handles the relationship between vectors, documents, and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manual approach - just embeddings\n",
    "docs = embeddings.embed_documents([chunk.page_content for chunk in speech_chunks])\n",
    "# docs = [[0.1, 0.5, ...], [0.3, 0.2, ...], ...]\n",
    "# Now what? You'd need to manually implement search\n",

    "## What FAISS.from_documents() Does Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extracts text from each document (`chunk.page_content`)\n",
    "2. Calls `embeddings.embed_documents()` on them\n",
    "3. Creates a FAISS index structure for efficient similarity search\n",
    "4. Stores the original documents and metadata alongside vectors\n",
    "5. Returns a searchable vectorstore object\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `embed_documents()` when:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to store vectors in a custom database\n",
    "- You need fine-grained control over the indexing process\n",
    "- You're building a custom retrieval system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `FAISS.from_documents()` when:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want a quick, working RAG system\n",
    "- You need standard similarity search functionality\n",
    "- You want LangChain integration for retrieval chains\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is more convenient for most RAG applications because it gives you a ready-to-use retrieval system rather than just raw vectors.\n"
